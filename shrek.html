      Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
      I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
      She was looking kind of d*mb with her finger and her thumb
      In the shape of an L on her forehead

      Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
      Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
      Didn't make sense not to live for fun
      Your brain gets smart but your head gets d*mb

      So much to do so much to see
      So what's wrong with taking the back streets
      You'll never know if you don't go
      You'll never shine if you don't glow

      Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
      Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
      And all that glitters is gold
      Only shooting stars break the mold
